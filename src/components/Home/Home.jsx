        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer dedicated to crafting seamless,
          user-friendly experiences. My background in medical market research
          and teaching English as a foreign language has sharpened my ability to
          understand client needs and effectively communicate solutions. With a
          tenacious, collaborative spirit, I strive to write elegant, intuitive,
          and stylish code that enhances user engagement and accessibility.
